### __About Myself:__

I am an English teacher with a deep-rooted passion for technology and a strong desire to transition into the field of frontend development. While I thoroughly enjoy teaching and helping students develop their language skills, my enthusiasm for technology has led me on a parallel path towards becoming a frontend developer.

Over the years, I have honed my teaching abilities, fostering an engaging and inclusive learning environment that promotes active participation and growth. I believe in tailoring my teaching methods to suit the unique needs of each student, enabling them to thrive in their language acquisition journey.

Simultaneously, my unwavering passion for technology has driven me to explore and develop my skills in frontend development. I have embarked on a self-guided learning journey, where I have acquired a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have actively participated in online communities and completed various online courses to further expand my knowledge.

I am highly motivated to combine my expertise in education with my technical skills to create innovative and user-friendly digital experiences. My goal is to leverage my teaching background, attention to detail, and creativity to contribute to the development of interactive and visually appealing websites and applications.

By bridging my experience as an English teacher with my growing proficiency in frontend development, I aim to create seamless user experiences that enhance communication and learning. I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in this dynamic field and look forward to embracing new challenges as I embark on my journey to become a successful frontend developer."
